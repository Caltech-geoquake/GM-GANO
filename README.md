The repository contains code for [Broadband Ground Motion Synthesis via Generative Adversarial Neural Operators: Development and Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03447)
for more information about GANO implementation, please refer to [GANO](https://github.com/neuraloperator/GANO)


## 

## Quick start of using trained GANO
please download the trained model through following link,  and store the model under `kik_net_trained_model` folder
